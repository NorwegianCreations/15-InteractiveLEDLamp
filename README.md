##Overview
This is the code used when generating patterns on an interactive LED Lamp we built last year. 
In addition to this code we used the required [Fadecandy library](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy), a Python-generated .json-file for LED-mapping and a Python script which sends a message each time we get a new like on Facebook. To run the code you also need to run the Fadecandy server. You can find instructions on how to do this on the Fadecandy github.
